                <p>Pim and Charlie are sent to cheer up Desmond, a deeply depressed man threatening himself. Pim
                    persistently tries to connect emotionally, taking him to an amusement park, sharing family time, and
                    giving him hope.</p>

                <h2>Setting up Shrimp’s date</h2>
                <p>For Shrimp, who’s heartbroken, Pim tries to reconnect him with his ex, Shrimpina. Pim’s idealism
                    leads
                    him to mistakenly court “Shrimpina” (Jennifer), developing feelings of his own, before doing the
                    right
                    thing.</p>

                <h2>Quest‑ing in the Enchanted Forest</h2>
                <p>When tasked to help a princess smile, Pim leads a fantasy-style quest. He becomes jealous of Mip (the
                    hobbit-like guide), culminating in a tragic confrontation where Pim accidentally kills Mip. He then
                    helps deliver Mip’s “gift” to the princess.</p>

                <p>In a later episode, Pim accompanies Charlie, Mr. Boss, and others to a forest retreat to “smell the
                    nature” — showing his loyalty and belief in the company’s mission.</p>
